    "This notebook is intended to give a (very brief) introduction to using the python programming language for data analysis. It's impossible to cover everything here, so you should expect to continue learning new topics as we work through data analysis exercises over the course of the semester. If you are feeling stuck, don't be afraid to turn to google -- the internet is a programmer's best friend!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following topics:\n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* Python basics: built-in functions, simple data types (strings, ints, floats), containers (tuples, lists, dicts), if statements, for loops\n",
    "* Writing functions\n",

    "In this class, we will do all of our data analysis using the python programming language in the [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) environment. In fact, you are looking at a Jupyter notebook right now. Jupyter is a web application that you access using your web browser. Visually, the notebook looks like a webpage that you can edit. It combines formatted text, images, and code. Underneath the hood, there is a python interpreter running on the host machine (in the OSC cluster). When you write new code or modify existing code, you can instruct the host machine to run it and then inspect the results, which might include text or numerical output, plots, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a great tool for data analysis because you can combine text that explains your analysis process, the code that actually runs your analysis, and plots that show your results. More traditional methods of publishing (like academic papers) usually describe the process and show results but omit the detailed code, which could make it much harder to duplicate results or find mistakes."

Try double-clicking on this cell and modifying the text. When you are done with a cell, you can \"run\" it by clicking on the right-arrow (play) button in the toolbar, or by typing shift-enter. When you run a Markdown (text) cell, all it does is properly format the text. Markdown refers to a simple and intuitive way of writing formatted text. You can learn about it [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), but any text will be fine for our purposes.\n",
