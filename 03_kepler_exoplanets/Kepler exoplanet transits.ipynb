    "# Fitting exoplanet transit models to Kepler light curves\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kepler](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/spacecraft/index.html) is a space telescope designed to search for planets around other stars (exoplanets). The primary detection technique used by Kepler is transit photometry. It continuously monitors a field of view containing ~150,000 main sequence stars for more than three years. If an exoplanet transits in front of any of those stars, it will be detected as a periodic dimming. It is important to remember that Kepler will find a **biased** population -- planets with large orbital radius have lower probability to be well-aligned for transits and their orbital periods could be too long for Kepler to observe periodicity.\n",

For this exercise, we are going to focus on [Kepler 8-b](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/published_planets/search.php?action=Search&kepler_name=Kepler-8+b) (Kepler ID 6922244).

Unfortunately the Nelder-Mead algorithm does not support bounded parameters. However, if you start from a good guess for the impact parameter, then you can probably get the minimization routine to converge without errors. Another option is to switch to a different algorithm -- several algorithms included with `minimize` do support parameter bounds (`'L-BFGS-B'`, `'TNC'`, `'SLSQP'` and `'trust-constr'`). See the [function documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you get your new fit to work, try plotting both versions of the fit (with and without impact parameter) against the data. Can you see a difference? Also compare the best fit values of $\\chi^2$ found in each case (remember, these are stored in `res.fun`)---a lower value of $\\chi^2$ means that your model is a better description of the data.\n"
