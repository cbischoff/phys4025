    "# Fitting exoplanet transit models to Kepler light curves\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kepler](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/spacecraft/index.html) is a space telescope designed to search for planets around other stars (exoplanets). The primary detection technique used by Kepler is transit photometry. It continuously monitors a field of view containing ~150,000 main sequence stars for more than three years. If an exoplanet transits in front of any of those stars, it will be detected as a periodic dimming. It is important to remember that Kepler will find a **biased** population -- planets with large orbital radius have lower probability to be well-aligned for transits and their orbital periods could be too long for Kepler to observe periodicity.\n",

For this exercise, we are going to focus on [Kepler 8-b](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/published_planets/search.php?action=Search&kepler_name=Kepler-8+b) (Kepler ID 6922244).
